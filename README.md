## View Deployed Site: https://codyalmand.github.io/Shoppies2021/

### Tools Utilized: React, Node, Axios, Bootstrap, Html, Css

## The Challenge 
We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

## Project Requirements: 
 * Search results should come from OMDB's API.
 *  Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
 *  Updates to the search terms should update the result list
 *  Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
 *  If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
 *  Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
